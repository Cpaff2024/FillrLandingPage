    <h1>Fillr Landing Page Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: April 11, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Fillr (operated by [Your Name/Company Name], "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects the personal information you provide when you sign up for updates via our landing page.</p>

    <h2>Data Controller</h2>
    <p>The data controller responsible for your personal data is [Your Name/Company Name]. You can contact us at [Your Contact Email Address].</p>

    <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you sign up on our landing page, we collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Name</li>
        <li>Your Email Address</li>
        <li>Your consent preference for receiving our optional monthly newsletter</li>
        <li>Timestamp of your sign-up</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect this information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To notify you via email when the Fillr app is launched (based on your primary consent).</li>
        <li>(Optional) To send you our monthly newsletter with app updates, impact stories, and case studies, if you explicitly opt-in (based on your separate consent).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>The lawful basis for collecting and processing your personal data for both the launch notification and the optional newsletter is your **Consent**, which you provide by actively ticking the relevant checkbox(es) on the sign-up form.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Processing</h2>
    <p>Your sign-up information (Name, Email, Newsletter Preference, Timestamp) is stored securely in a Google Sheet file hosted on Google Drive. The data is processed using Google Apps Script to transfer it from the landing page form to the Google Sheet and potentially to send you the welcome email and subsequent communications you consented to.</p>
    <p>Google acts as a data processor for this storage and processing. We rely on Google's security measures for Google Workspace/Drive. You can review Google's privacy policies for more information.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We will retain your personal data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For launch notifications: Until the main launch notification email has been sent, after which data collected solely for this purpose may be deleted.</li>
        <li>For the monthly newsletter: For as long as you remain subscribed. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link provided in every newsletter, after which your data will be removed from the active mailing list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>Under GDPR, you have several rights regarding your personal data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'):</strong> You can request deletion of your personal data under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You can request that we limit the processing of your data under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Object to Processing:</strong> You can object to the processing of your data (e.g., for the newsletter) at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> You can withdraw your consent for the newsletter at any time by unsubscribing. Withdrawing consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [Your Contact Email Address].</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data. We do not share your personal data with third parties, other than Google for the storage (Google Sheets) and processing (Google Apps Script, potentially Gmail via MailApp) purposes described above.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>Our landing page does not currently use cookies for tracking or analytics. If this changes, this policy will be updated.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
